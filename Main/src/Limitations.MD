#Overview
The final project challenges you to incorporate as many Java topics covered throughout the school year(CSCI 21 and CSCI 22). 
You may work individually, or you may work with a partner. The task is to design and implement a multiplayer network game.

Except for Bricks,Pong ,Tic Tac Toe,Space Invaders,and Memory Cards, the game may be based on 
existing games such as board games, card games, or other graphic multiplayer games, but they cannot be copies of the existing game. 
They must somehow be modified. You are not allowed to find a game development tutorial and submit the output from following 
that tutorial. It can be an original game as well.
