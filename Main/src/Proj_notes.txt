General (AKA Implement anywhere)
1. A hit counter/hit detection
2. Figure out which parts of the application needs to be divided into threads
3. Implement a start menu and quit menu

- For the requirement (Extend two classes)
Title screen class extends FInalProj.Circle  (Big - Red FInalProj.Circle) (Once enter is clicked it disappears)
(Maybe make a special class to shoot 3 circles at a time)

##Find a way to implement either

(In the FInalProj.Player class)
1 - FInalProj.Player presses space bar --> it generates a circle object which then gets displayed
or
2 - FInalProj.Player presses space bar --> it generates a scripted number
of circle objects and prevents the player from generating more
(This may make the networking code less complex)

(In the FInalProj.PlayerRectangles class)
   public void friendlyKeybindingMovement(int x){
        /* use this when implementing KeyMap and actionMap in the player class
         * Friendly movement right arrow key = positive +=x
         * Friendly movement left arrow key = negative +=-x
         * Implement collision/edge detection in the player class
         */

    }

    public void enemyMovement(int x){
        /* Use this when implementing KeyMap and actionMap in the player class
         * enemy movement right arrow key = +=-x
         * Friendly movement left arrow key = +=x
         * Implement collision/edge detection in the player class
         */

    }

    //public displayEnemy() - implement later using DataOutputStream in Java Socket

(In the FInalProj.GameStarter and FInalProj.GameServer class)
Implement:
1. Networking Code
2. DataOutputStreams to return objects to mirror enemy player movement
